            <p>With less than 30 stalls, Dunman Food Centre is one of the smallest hawker centres in Singapore but it has a surprising number of notable hawker stalls under its roof.
                <br><br>Many of the street hawkers from the Joo Chiat and Katong area were housed here between 1974 and 1976 and the hawker centre recently underwent a major renovation and officially reopened on February 2015.
                <br><br>Timing is key if you're after a certain hawker, half of its stalls open from the morning to the afternoon and the other half from the evening until late at night.

            <p>Although I see this stall on the way home, I have never tried this wanton mee before. The story behind it is that there was once a grandfather who gave his Wonton Mee stall to his two grandsons. They both shared it by taking weekly turns to run the stall. This went on for a while until the elder brother decided to open a 24 hour stall right next to the old stall. Now the older brother operates the 24 hour stall, but still retains his alternate weekly routine at the old stall. The older brother then starts making his noodles in a factory instead, while the younger one persists in making his in the same manner as his grandfather. This place is really open 24 hours so you can come down anytime to give it a try.

            <p>This stall is located directly behind my house so it is very convenient for me to go there and eat. I like this place’s duck rice a lot because of their chilli. They have 2 different types of chilli there, one sweet and one spicy, I love the sweet one.
            <br><br>The Yu Kee flagship outlet is located in Kim San Leng Food Court, along Bishan. At present, Yu Kee House Of Braised Duck has five outlets spread across Bishan, Joo Chiat, Ang Mo Kio, Adam Road, and Lavender. There are plans to open their sixth outlet along Beach Road early next year. 
            <br><br>The story behind this popular stall dates way back to 1954, when first generation founder Seah Teck Yew started hawking braised duck from a push-cart along old Yishun road. The Yu Kee brand, along with its recipe, was then passed on to his son and daughter-in-law, who opened their first stall in the now-shuttered Lakeview Food Centre.

            <p>In 1960, it was at Jalan Kayu where Mr Tan under the watchful eye of his elder cousin, masterminded the fine art of frying Hokkien Mee. Five years later, he set up his own stall and in 1971 he moved to Changi Road.
            <br><br>Having good business, he then went on to establish his very own Eating House in 1984, engaging a number of chefs to assist him in seafood Zi-Char but business was not brisk. It was then that Mr Tan decided to take over kitchen duties and revolutionize his business. Besides his traditional Hokkien Mee, he also introduced Sambal Kang Kong, Black Pepper Crab, in Hotpot, Claypot Abalone Hokkien Mee, Fish Maw Soup, Spicy Bean Sauce Steamed Tilapia and a host of other detectable items. Since 1988 Mr Tan Hock Yong (son of senior Tan) started to assist & learn his trade while the business took off.

            <p>Long Phung Vietnamese Restaurant at Joo Chiat Road is established in 2009, almost a decade ago. It’s a casual restaurant with plastic chairs and veneer tables. 
            <br><br>The service is atrocious. If you try to speak to one of them and they might turn away abruptly like they didn’t hear you. But I think the staff aren’t intentionally rude. It’s because there are only three of them handling a very busy restaurant, and many of them don’t speak English; they are Vietnamese.

            <p>This is a famous fishball noodle stall and my family likes to come here to eat dinner sometimes. What I find different is that they not only give fishballs in their noodles, but also a tau pok and a fish dumpling. There used to be an ice cream stall there as well but now it’s not there anymore.
