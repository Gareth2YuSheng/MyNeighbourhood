               <p>Tao Nan School is a co-educational primary school in Singapore. One of the six Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan schools, along with Ai Tong School, Chongfu Primary School, Kong Hwa School, Nan Chiau Primary School and Nan Chiau High School, Tao Nan School is among the 30 most popular primary schools listed by the Ministry of Education.[1]
                  <br><br>Tao Nan School is also offering the Gifted Education Programme that started in 1996. In 2007, it also started the Bi-Cultural Chinese Elective Programme (BiCEP) to develop effective bilingualism in its students. Tao Nan celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2006 with a carnival held on November 4. To provide better infrastructure to support the teaching and learning of its students, Tao Nan School underwent the PERI Upgrading from 2014 to 2015 and operated at the holding site in Bedok South Road. With the completion of the Upgrading Exercise, it returned to Marine Parade in 2016.

               <p>Saint Patrick's School is a Lasallian Roman Catholic boys' secondary school in East Coast Road, Singapore. It is more commonly referred to as St Pat's, SPS or St Patrick's. Students and old boys call themselves Patricians or Sons of St. Patrick's. The school is well known for its Military Band, which has performed internationally and won awards.
                  <br><br>The school was founded in 1933 as a temporary branch school of Saint Joseph's Institution, another Catholic boys' school in Singapore. It was built on land acquired by the La Salle Brothers in 1898, land intended for a resort bungalow for the brothers. But Brother Stephen Buckley saw the population growth in the eastern side of the island and petitioned the La Salle Brothers to build a school on this piece of land. The main school building was completed in 1932, and Saint Patrick's became a school in its own right in 1933.
                  <br><br>During World War II, the school was used by the British as a hospital and later by the Japanese as an administrative building. It was returned to the Brothers in 1946.

               <p>In 1854, Reverend Mother Mathilde arrived in Singapore from Penang and remained as Mother Superior of the Convent  for the next 20 years. The sisters got to work and within 10 days took in orphans, did needlework to support themselves and taught 14 children. Soon the number of pupils increased and the school became well-known. In 1894, there were 167 pupils. By 1904, the number had increased to 300. Secondary education began in 1905. Under Mother Hombeline the expansion programme continued.
                  <br><br>
                  Katong Convent was established in 1930 as a private Primary English School with an enrolment of 197 pupils, one of 11 CHIJ schools in Singapore. In 1958, in order to cope with the growing demand for places in the school, a branch was constructed in Opera Estate and a few of the Primary school staff were then transferred to the new convent. The new school was named CHIJ Opera Estate. In 1988, work on the project to build a “new school” at Marine Terrace began. The relocation of CHIJ Opera Estate to Katong in 1990 also marked another milestone in the history of the school; for the new name adopted – CHIJ (Katong) Primary, is also reflective of the merger with the primary section of Katong Convent.

               <p>CHIJ Katong Convent (CHIJ – KC) is an autonomous all-girls Catholic secondary school in Singapore.
                  <br><br>
                  The school is one of 11 Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus (CHIJ) schools in Singapore. Katong Convent is known for providing its students with a holistic and well-balanced education. school has produced successful alumni who serve in many facets of society.
                  <br><br>
                  In the 1920s, the Sisters of the Holy Infant Jesus acquired one of the private bungalows on the eastern coast of Singapore as a weekend holiday bungalow for the nuns and boarders of the convent.
                  <br><br>
                  In 1930, these buildings were used as a private school and in 1932 the school was given a grant-in-aid status. The first set of students registered in January 1932 was mixed – 171 girls and 26 boys. Upon the completion of St Patrick's School in late 1932, these boys were transferred there. Katong Convent was no larger than a village school, consisting of four classes and a total enrolment of 197 students. Sister St Theodora was the first principal with a staff of only four teachers.
                  <br><br>
                  Under Sister St Vincent de Paul, the school building was extended in 1939 with eight new classrooms. In 1941, just before the outbreak of the war, there were 384 pupils – 60 in the secondary classes, 206 in the elementary and 118 in the primary. There were four nuns including the principal, and eight local teachers.

                  Ngee Ann Primary School was formerly known as Ngee Ann Girls’ School. In 1940, Ngee Ann Kongsi's Board of Directors comprising the late Mr Lee Wee Nam, the late Mr Yeo Chan Boon, the late Mr Lim Kim Seng and a few other members set up this institution to encourage education for girls.   The school ground was a bungalow owned by a Kongsi member situated at 229, River Valley Road, where Teo Yeonh Huai Kuan stands today. During the Japanese Occupation, the girls’ school was forced to close down but was reinstated shortly after the war in the mid 1950s. At that time, the school population increased to about 1000 and it also achieved the status of a government-aided school.

                  Victoria Junior College (also known as Victoria or VJC) is a highly selective, coeducational junior college in Singapore offering pre-university education to boarding and day-students. The school was founded in 1984, although its predecessor and affiliated institution, Victoria School, was founded in 1876. It stands on Marine Vista, less than one kilometre from the affiliated Victoria School.
                  <br><br>
                  VJC is part of the Victoria-Cedar alliance, and is one of Singapore's top Junior Colleges. The school's programmes and activities are advised by the Victoria Advisory Committee, while day-to-day operations of the school is run by the School Principal. Tutors and faculty members are responsible for the governance of student-life.
